1) After fresh install had to install following 

npm install socket.io

npm install mongoose
 
 sudo npm install bso 

2) Trying mongo express for mongo admin as developers

sudo npm install mongo-express


3) Useful links for video streaming etc.
 (Ignore for now, reference for future)

https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-media-player

https://www.npmjs.com/package/streaming-s3   (Amazon s3 we will be using to upload.)

What video code (http://www.olindata.com/blog/2014/01/file-uploading-and-streaming-binaryjs)
is using (Can be used in other scenarios)
http://binaryjs.com/


3.1 : Also as we will be transfering file on s3 in future so 
https://angular-file-upload.appspot.com/
seems to be a good option.


4) For admin looked into penguin, drywall etc but following looks promising 
https://allcountjs.com/
