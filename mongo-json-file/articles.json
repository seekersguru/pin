But factors like delays in statutory and other approvals for projects and negligent credit appraisal and loan monitoring by banks are also significant causes of generation of non-performing loans (NPLs }. There has been a significant rise in NPLs in the last couple of years in the banks in India. </p><p>High loan exposures by the banks to certain sectors and high leverage by companies have compounded the problem of NPLs for Indian banks.The Indian banking system’s gross NPLs rose to 3.6% in March 2013 from 2.5% in March 2011. Currently, it is closer to 4% or nearly INR 244,000 crore (~US$41 billion }.  To make matters worse, banks in India have large amounts of restructured loans. Restructured loans are those where the repayment period is extended and in most cases the interest rate is also lowered. According to industry sources, India has about US$84 billion of loans that have been restructured as the borrowers were distressed and would have otherwise defaulted. </p><h2>Need for resolving </h2><div><br/></div><div>NPLs NPLs are not only a drag on the banks but also on the economy as a whole. Higher NPL ratios stifle the ability of banks to lend and also tend to keep interest rates higher than the guidance provided by the monetary policy. In a slowing economy, slower lending compounds the difficulties of the banks itself as well as the government. Effective reduction in NPLs and improvements in the loan recovery process are key to maintaining the financial health of banks. In late 1990s and early part of the last decade, NPLs in the Indian banking system were on the rise.  While banks have the necessary powers to take steps to recover NPLs or bad loans but lack adequate resources to actually do it. </div><div><br/></div><h2> Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs } </h2><div><br/></div><div>One of the steps the government took to address the issue was to set up ‘asset reconstruction companies’ (ARCs }. These companies buy NPLs from banks at a discount to the current value of the bad loans.  “Banks although had powers but efficient no machineries to recover, so asset reconstruction companies became the focal point for recovery,” according to Siby Antony, managing director and CEO of Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company. India got its first ARC after a law was enacted in 2002 for Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and for Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI }. Antony says: “The Sarfaesi law has significantly been strengthened over time and the process of taking possession and selling of the assets charged to lenders as security against loans has become much easier.” The objective of ARCs is focused management of NPLs and optimal recovery, thereby relieving banks and financial institutions of the burden of NPLs and allowing them to focus on their core activity of lending. When the NPLs are sold, the capital that’s blocked by the bad loans gets freed for fresh lending, which in turn helps boost economic activity. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI } issues ARC licenses to ‘strong experience person, and credible institution or corporate’ according to an industry participant. </div><div><br/></div><div>It has issued 14 licences so far - </div><div>Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company</div><div>ASERC (India } LimitedAsset Reconstruction Company (India }Limited</div><div>Asset Care Enterprises Limited</div><div>Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited</div><div>India SME Asset Reconstruction Company</div><div>International Asset Reconstruction Company Private Ltd</div><div>INVENT Asset Securitisation and Reconstruction Private Ltd</div><div>JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Private Ltd</div><div>Pegasus Asset Reconstruction Private Ltd</div><div>Phoenix ARC Private Ltd</div><div>Pridhvi Asset Reconstruction and Securitisation Company Ltd </div><div>Reliance Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd</div><div>UV Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd </div><div><br/></div><div>There are restrictions such as no single investor can own majority in ARCs. The main shareholder or ‘sponsor’ can own only upto 49.9% of the ARC, ensuring it is widely held. Some of the ARCs are part of larger financial services groups such as Edelweiss, JM Financial, Reliance and Phoenix (part of Kotak Mahindra Bank group }. They got into the business with their proprietary funds. Edelweiss ARC has acquired NPAs worth over INR 9,000 crore (US$ 1.5 billion } while Phoenix ARC has issued around  2,000 crore (US$ 333 million } worth of security receipts till date. </div><div><br/></div><h2>Shifting NPLs to security receipts </h2><div><br/></div><div>Essentially, ARCs buy NPLs from banks and recover as much money as is optimally possible.  The purchase is usually through transaction-specific trusts. The trust buys a single or portfolio of NPLs from a bank and issues security receipts (bonds } to institutional investors. However, since the institutional investor base for these instruments has been shallow, the selling banks themselves end up buying the security receipts. So effectively, the bank sells NPLs and buys security receipts as investments. Security receipts are considered standard (good } asset for one year. RBI subsequently made it mandatory for ARCs to invest own funds in at least 5% of the security receipts issued in every transaction. Antony of Edelweiss says, “ARCs have a challenge in raising resources either by way of capital or loans given the limited avenues of exit or uncertain cash flows. Therefore, in Indian context, ARCs function as a catalyst for NPA management with the issue 95% security receipts and ARCs investment limited to 5%.” Eshwar Karra, CEO of Phoenix ARC, says: “The challenge is in respect of from whom we can raise this money. We can raise this money from QIBs (Qualified Institutional Buyers } such as NBFCs (non-bank finance companies }, mutual funds, insurance companies, foreign institutional investors, etc. “ </div><div><br/></div><h2>Reconstruction process </h2><div><br/></div><div>ARCs have a limited range of options to add value including loan collection or settlement, selling assets and restructuring. Firms tend to focus on one or more of these options depending on their skills. Karra of Phoenix ARC says, “We believe the best value is when we try to rehabilitate the company and try to operationally turn it around, where the delta (return } is huge. We try to focus more on operational turnaround.” Karra also preferred to focus on single loans rather than a portfolio, saying, “This means, if I see a company and I feel I can rehabilitate it, then we will consider it for the reconstruction process… Take for example Kingfisher Airlines. If I do find that I could add some value over there then I will approach the consortium of lenders. I would be the first to approach the company and analyse how to turn the company around. We would subsequently approach the consortium of lenders and give them a revival proposal.” Others may focus on financial engineering i.e. settlement of dues or selling assets. Another industry participant said, “It’s fairly complex as you should have very strong financial skills, negotiation skills and legal skills…but, in turn, the return profile can be very good.” The internal rate of return for ARCs can be upwards of 30%, though the returns from the AIFs are likely to be in the 20-22% range.  Obviously there are risks including the potential for capital loss if efforts to operationally turnaround a company fail or recovery of dues in cash or from sale of assets does not work out as planned. </div><div><br/></div><h2>Accessing HNIs through AIFs </h2><div><br/></div><div>The combined net worth of all ARCs is just US$400 million, grossly inadequate given the size of NPLs. Karra of Phoenix says “the proprietary capital with ARCs cannot take care of the NPLs opportunity, which is why AIFs are being set up. The requirement for special funds is huge and there are private equity players like KKR, Blackstone, Apollo who are getting into the Indian special business.” </div><div><br/></div><div>Savvy high net worth individuals (HNIs } have also started to show interest in investing in the distressed debt assets, whether through non-convertible debt in the real estate sector, or via ARCs in the manufacturing sector. To take advantage of this interest, some ARCs have started to set up alternative investment funds (AIFs } through their group companies. Antony of Edelweiss ARC mentioned that Edelweiss Stressed and Troubled Assets Revival Fund (E-Star Fund }, is currently raising capital. Kotak Alternative Investment Advisers has also recently launched a fund and is raising capital through an AIF in collaboration with Phoenix ARC. “With over 6 lakh crores of loans restructured and about 2 lakhs to 3 lakhs of NPAs, ARCs are called upon to play much larger role in the distressed assets space,” concludes Antony. </div><p></p>","discovered":false,"keywords":[],"nFavorites":0,"pin":true,"public":true,"mmitags":["Client onboarding","risk profiling","behavioural finance"],"tags":["Trusts","Wills","Governance"],"mmicategory":"WM/distribution","mmisubcategory":"Advisory process","title":"Distressed debt as an asset class"}

This year’s conference was attended by more than 200 high net worth investors and philanthropists, including some from around the world.The presentation and book summarised the key theme – people who invest time and money into philanthropy and impact investing want their efforts to be meaningful; and that can only be achieved by clearly defining and measuring the objectives.With 95% of the world’s largest 250 corporations now tracking and reporting publicly on their social impact, there is a need for setting a defined structure and decoding social impact to make it more transparent.The book is based on a large multinational field project which involved interviews with over 60 large organisations around the world which includes Gates Foundation, Godrej, Robinhood Foundation, Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Omidyar Network, Kiawah Trust, Skoll Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and corporations, philanthropistand individual investors to name a few. Through examples, the book acts as a guide in defining measuring and improving social impact.</div><p><br/></p><h2>Identifying objectives and setting up processes</h2><div><br/></div><div>Epstein shared some interesting perspectives with the audience. He pointed out that there is a lack of clarity amongst the organisations, NGOs and individuals in defining the goals in impact investment. “If there is no clear understanding in what they are trying to achieve, then how can a process be developed to achieve it. There needs to be an alignment in the understating of objectives and outcome between the investor and foundation,” Epstein said.</div><div><br/></div><div>Assuming that social impact is the crux of the matter, the book compelsinvestors toask some important questions like why are we investing (objective }, what are the best processes (ideal roadmap to achieve the objective }, what is it that we want to invest in (resource allocation }, where can we make the most impact ourselves (positioning }, where to invest (viability and achievability }, how to improve social impact (maximising the positive multiplier effect }, etc.</div><div><br/></div><div>Once these questions have been answered, stakeholders can be clearer about setting up of objectives, which further facilitates in development of a model and processes to achieve and improve the social impact on the society.</div><div><br/></div><h2>Measuring social impact</h2><div><br/></div><div>Epstein observed that organisations are now demanding more accountability out of their social impact investments. Corporations, individual investors and philanthropists are increasingly getting more involved in the social causes and want to ensure optimum utilisation of the investments (money, time, expertise and reputation } for maximum social impact.This brings forth the need to have a measurement mechanism in place to ascertain the level of social impact achieved and identify the gaps (if any } in the desired output and also bring about a course correction to improve the social impact.Epstein works with Rice University. Prior to this, he was associated with Stanford Business School and Harvard Business School faculty. Co-author Kristi Yuthas is a professor at the Portland State University. They have done work in education, health, micro finance, micro entrepreneurship sectors and companies like Nike, P&G, Apple, Nissan and many other leading corporations of the world have been a part of their research.  </div><p></p>","discovered":false,"keywords":[],"nFavorites":0,"pin":true,"public":true,"mmitags":["Client onboarding","risk profiling","behavioural finance"],"tags":["Trusts","Wills","Governance"],"mmicategory":"WM/distribution","mmisubcategory":"Advisory process","title":"Measuring impact of impact investments"}

However, more recently there has been discussion around impact investing, which leads to the broader discussion of incorporating the need for making an impact within the investments rather than allocating a smaller part to philanthropy.This approach of influencing change within the investment portfolio is more prevalent amongst institutional investors. Traditional investments focus on finance only; philanthropy focuses on impact only.Yet the new paradigm is the combination of the two. The continuum is from traditional investments to philanthropy, covering screened (such as ethical investments }, responsible or ESG funds (environmental, social and governance }, themed, and impact funds.</p><h2>Responsible investing</h2><p>Responsible Investment (RI } is an approach to investment that explicitly acknowledges the relevance to the investor of ESG factors, and of the long-term health and stability of the market as a whole. It recognises that the generation of long-term sustainable returns is dependent on stable, well-functioning and well-governed social, environmental and economic systems. RI can be differentiated from conventional approaches to investment in two ways.</p><p>The first is that time frames are important; the goal is the creation of sustainable, long-term investment returns not just short-term returns.The second is that RI requires investors to pay attention to the wider contextual factors, including the stability and health of economic and environmental systems and the evolving values and expectations of the societies of which they are part.</p><p>The belief is that these issues will be increasingly key drivers of industrial and economic change, and the most successful companies are likely to be those that ent by respond most effectively to these challenges. Institutional investors have adopted a global framework for RI by becoming signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investments (UN PRI }.</p><h2>Impact investing</h2><p>Impact investments are defined as: “...investments made into companies, organisations and funds with the intention to generate measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below market to market rate, depending upon the circumstances. Impact investors actively seek to place capital in businesses and funds that can harness the positive power of enterprise.” (Global Impact Investing Network, 2012 }</p><p>Within impact investing, a distinction is made between “financial first” and “impact first” investors.“Impact first” investors seek to optimise social or environmental returns while agreeing the minimum target financial returns (a financial 'floor' } while “financial first” investors seek to optimise financial with a floor for social or environmental impact (Rockefeller Philanthropic Advisors, 2009 }.Investors may choose to dedicate a small percentage to investments in social and / or environmental areas, via a dedicated team. Alternatively, they may seek environmental and / or social themed opportunities across asset classes and investment teams. Allocations are usually small in comparison to investors' total assets under management. Investors also have the opportunity to invest in impact investment funds or directly as angel investments.

Screwvala believes, “India cannot rise to its true potential without a fundamental transformation in the lives of people in rural India”.</p><div>“For over a year, we met other philanthropists, visited many villages and NGOs and realised that a lot of people were focusing on a single sector and within the sector, focusing on a specific area. And our dream is to eradicate poverty and one focus area will not do the trick because poverty is a complex web of material and mental barriers,” says Screwvala. </div><div><br/></div><div>Swades has implemented a holistic 360-degree programme, focusing on community mobilisation, water and sanitation, agriculture and livelihood, and health and nutrition. “So when we say we reach a person, we reach the person directly, day after day, multiple times because of our multiple touch points, deep intervention model. And our dream is to scale this model up and lift a million people out of poverty every five years,” Screwvala says. Over the past year, Swades has increased its reach from 160 villages to 1,000 villages and this year aims to expand to 2000 villages with a strong focus in Maharashtra. </div><div><br/></div><h2>Engagement model</h2><div>Swades’ engagement model relies on four main pillars – engage, empower, execute and exit. Swades engages rural communities with corporates, young urban India, not-for-profit organizations and governments and empower them to execute programs that transform their own lives.This self-sustainable model enables Swades to exit the programme and give community people an opportunity to serve as role models and change agents for others.“Our strength lies in our team of specialists and professions both at corporate and grassroots committed to sustainable growth. Swades is primarily supported and sponsored by Unilazer Ventures Pvt Ltd and today, we are well on our way to achieving our mission of transforming the lives of 1 million people in rural India in 5 years,” adds Screwvala.</div><div><br/></div><h2>The empowered self and community</h2><p>According to Screwvala, the ‘Swa’ in their name reflects ‘empowered self’ forming the core of everything they do. She further adds, “After four months of rigorous training, our first batch of 134 ‘Swarakshamitras’ (local community change evangelists } went ahead and organised four eye camps on their own within two weeks of finishing their training. That according us is change. So, if we can just make all these people our leaders, then it can definitely become a movement, where people take pride in rural India.”In order to make the best of the unused land available, Swades is also creating community farming, where farmers can grow different crops such as mangoes and cashews. “While each farmer might have his own farm, they might be small in size. However, the unused land, community farm, can be utilised where the options for agriculture are enormous,” believes Screwvala.</p><h2>Challenges and future plans</h2><p>Money is always an issue according to Screwvala. “Despite having money, we have a lack of financial reserve. Our only and biggest asset is the trust of the community. Also, we do this full-time. Our team is phenomenal, sticking with us through all the ups and downs,” she adds. Despite the challenges, over the past two years, Swades has reached out to over 275,000 people in the next one year, Swades plans to reach out to 600,000 more people. On the education front, Swades Foundation was present in 135 schools last year and this year it plans to be present in 590 more schools.Screwvala attributes this growth to the team at Swades. “Across the board, we are able to scale our projects at this rate only because of the team, here in Mumbai and on the ground,” she says.She concludes saying, “I am very hopeful about the world today. Once they know that the organisation is committed and not here to scam you, they pull together and give. I think the young generation is very different and they bring tremendous hope to the table”. </p><p><br/></p><p></p>","discovered":false,"keywords":[],"nFavorites":0,"pin":true,"public":true,"title":"Empowering rural India","mmitags":["Client onboarding","risk profiling","behavioural finance"],"tags":["Trusts","Wills","Governance"],"mmicategory":"WM/distribution","mmisubcategory":"Advisory process"}

It exited its second investment, also made in 2002, in two phases in 2003 and 2009, and the IRR was 45%.So far, Aavishkaar has made five full exits at IRRs ranging from 12% to 197%. The portfolio returns would, however, be at a realistic level as it has had to write off 0% to 75% of the capital invested in seven companies.Vineet Rai, founder and managing director, Aavishkaar, says: “In 2001, we started saying we can provide 8% return but no one believed us. The first fund we raised, will give about 14% return.”</p><p>Not all impact investing platforms promise this level of return. For example, Ankur Capital, the first social impact fund registered under the new AIF regime,estimates lower returns of 8% to 10%.Abhay Garg, portfolio manager, Acumen Fund, says: “We underwrite a deal with say a return of 15% to 20%. Given the high failure rates and early-stage breakthrough ideas that we are supporting, we expect the fund as a portfolio to have 1x returns.” In addition, the indefinable return that one gets from impact investing is the difference social enterprises make to the bottom-of-the pyramid communities they operate in. These returns are from investments in companies which do not have access to commercial capital and where the risks are very high.Garg of Acumen, says: “You can’t solve social problems like in a private equity deal in 3 or 5 years. Patient capital through longer term investments that emphasis both social and financial returns is very critical for this ecosystem.”<br/></p><p>The wait for returns from social investing is longer than in venture capital. It could be as much as 10 years. Social investing funds are quick to point out that it took 8 to 10 years for investors to make money from their investments in companies like Facebook and Twitter. <br/></p><h2><span>Buzz around impact investing</span><br/></h2><h2><span>The term &#34;impact investing&#34; was coined in 2007 but the buzz around impact investing is recent. The World Economic Forum’s (WEF } 2013 annual meeting at Davos in Switzerland for the first time had impact investing on its agenda.The intention of impact investing is to provide capital to for-profit social enterprises providing services to deprived communities and simultaneously earn a return on the investments. These enterprises do not have access to commercial capital. These enterprises are generally engaged commercial activities in healthcare, education, energy, water and sanitation, agriculture and low-cost housing sectors.<br/></span></h2><p><br/></p><p>The WEF in its September 2013 report on mainstreaming of impact investing, said in a study across 18 countries, respondents ranked “to improve society” as the number one priority of business. This suggests that the emerging generation of investors is also likely to seek achievement of social objectives in addition to financial returns.Various agencies have estimated that the size of impact investing globally would be US$400 billion to US$1 trillion by 2020 from around US$40 billion now.A avishkaar estimates total impact investments in India to be about US$1.6 billion so far. The expectation is that the pace of impact investing will multiply from now on.Rai of Aavishkaar says: “We raised our first US$1 million in 5 years. In next seven years, we raised US$155 million.”“As more investments of our become successful, we believe more high net worth Indians would find impact investing attractive,” added Rai.Aavishkaar is now looking to expand its impact investing operations beyond India. It has launched Aavishkaar Frontier Fund to focus on South-east Asia and South Asia. The fund will invest in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.<br/></p><p>Acumen has made impact investments of more than US$87 million in 81 companies in various countries. In India, it has invested over US$32 million across 27 companies.</p><h2>Examples</h2><p>Ankur has invested a total of INR 1.2 crore (US$200,000 } in three companies. It shared the investments to give examples of impact investing: An eye care company - in north east-upper Assam, an area with very little medical facilities. Close to 20% of the population of the north-eastern Indian state have visual challenges. Of these 40%, or 8% to 10% of population, have refractive errors, which can be easily resolved by a pair of spectaclesA mobile, GPS based farm ERP, which helps small farmers connect with global supply chains, resulting in better inputs and better prices. This is a great solution to digitise agriculture, which has so far been untouched by technologyA waste management company - facilitating home composting using pots from rural potters, thereby not only reducing waste, but also increasing income for rural potters</p><p>Rema Subramanian, director of Ankur, says: “The money invested in the eye-care company is our own and also funds raised from family and friends. Our target is to now raise INR 40 crore.”Ankur already has a pipeline of social enterprises ready to invest in. It will choose 20 enterprises to invest in and expects to deploy the entire amount to be raised in 2 years. Subramanian said: “We are looking at both institutional capital as well as individual capital. Individual capital we are looking at is from professionals. Our intention is to involve investing professionals as advisors in the investee companies.”The due diligence for choosing to invest in a social enterprise is as rigorous as a venture capital fund.</p><p>Acumen applies bothfinancial and social triggers in making an investment decision. Its criteria includes: (i } Innovation in the product, the technology or the mode of delivery of a critical good or service,;(ii } financial viability and sustainability of the enterprise; and (iii } potential for large-scale social impact.Garg of Acumen says, “We are as professional – in terms of origination, diligence, executive and post investment management.”</p><h2>Measuring the impact</h2><p>As the interest in imact investing grows, investors are increasingly asking for more accountability. While there are some frameworks to measure the social impact at the enterprise level, there is also interest in value added by the fund.Prashant Chandrasekaran, engagement  manager – business consulting services at Intellecap, says: “There is a need to identify what role an impact fund is playing as distinct from a venture capital or a private equity fund.”The non-financial impact needs to be measured in terms of the change in the economic conditions of the customers of social enterprises. Intellecap has made an effort to come up with a measurement framework which will also take into account aspects like: (i } the geographical regions where the fund has invested and at  what stage; (ii } is the fund doing things that other people are not? and (iii } is the fund support innovation in any sense, even if it is just incremental innovation?Chandrasekaran says: “This is an industry which has never had any standardised assessment framework. Rating remains a challenge. There is no consensus on what all needs to be included. We have tried to take a crack at that. We have got a much broader reporting framework.”<br/></p>","discovered":false,"keywords":[],"mmicategory":"WM/distribution","mmisubcategory":"Advisory process","mmitags":["Client onboarding","risk profiling","behavioural finance"],"money":true,"nFavorites":0,"pin":true,"public":true,"tags":["Equities","Fixed Interest","Real Estate","Cash","Global","Alternatives"],"title":"Invest patient capital for impact"}
