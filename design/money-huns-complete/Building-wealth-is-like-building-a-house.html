<p>You might have heard or read comments like “asset allocation is the most important decision you will make about your money.” And most financial advisers and sites ask you to take a ‘risk profile’ questionnaire to arrive at the ‘optimal asset allocation'. The problem is that such suggestions usually leave out the home, and sometimes the bank savings accounts etc that advisers don’t have control over and can’t charge fees on. The rationale is that the home would skew the asset allocation towards real estate. So their asset allocation recommendation is only really for the financial assets.</p>

<p>For a lot of people, the home is the most significant investment they would have ever made in their lives. So then the question is - is it right to leave it out of the asset allocation? What’s the purpose of asset allocation anyway? Do we need a ‘scientifically optimised asset allocation’ as advisers claim? Is there a simpler way to think about one’s money.</p>

<p>I believe there is.</p>

<p>How we think</p>

<p>You might have noticed that people tend to divide and label things. You divide your apartment into rooms – living room, bedroom, kitchen etc – and put in things appropriate to their uses. You divide your clothes by their use too – work, leisure, party etc. You get the idea.</p>

<p>Similarly, most people intuitively divide their money into ‘mental accounts’ – emergency money, saving for a house and kids’ education, retirement etc. Some divide their money into actual accounts to help them manage.</p>

<p>Since money is fungible (as in the same money can be used for anything), the financial industry calls this behaviour of setting up multiple accounts ‘irrational’, although I bet, like me, a lot of industry people still do it. Irrational or not, I believe it’s best to work with how people think anyway.</p>

<h3>What do we want from our money</h3>

<p>You may have heard of a concept called Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. It basically says that humans start with the most basic needs, and as these are met, they aspire for higher needs. The most basic need is physiological, and the highest is self-actualisation.</p>

<p>We can translate this concept to our money. All said and done, we all want three things from our money – </p>
<ul>
<li> Certainty of maintaining basic standard of living - basically we don’t want to jeopardise our basic standard of living i.e. the house we live in, essential lifestyle (food, clothing, education, car etc), and some discretionary spending (holidays, gadgets etc). We keep some part of our wealth for emergencies, whether in cash or in highly liquid form such as gold. We will not tolerate any downside on these</li>

<li> High probability of maintaining lifestyle and wealth - we want to maintain the purchasing power of our wealth i.e. it should grow at least in line with inflation.</li>

<li> Possibility of a windfall to enhance lifestyle – we want to be the inventor of the next facebook! Jokes aside, we want to move into a higher strata of society by taking some risks. This could be by starting our own business or investing in other start-ups. Salaried employees take employee stock options, which could become a windfall if the shares of the employer company perform well. We realise we could lose all of this money – but we are willing to risk it for the huge upside. So this is ‘play money’.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Think about these for a moment.</h3>

<p>Note the three words – certainty, high probability and possibility – to describe these goals. They give us a clue about the risk people are willing to tolerate. Certainty implies no downside risk. High probability allows for a small risk or low odds. Possibility is just that – a possibility that a dream could turn into reality.</p>

<h3>Taking an overall wealth approach or 3-bucket approach</h3>

<p>Let’s turn these three wants into three buckets for your wealth and label them. We could call them Essentials, Growth and Freedom. You can label them differently if you wish; other suggestions are Safety. Income, and Aspirational. I used to simply call them short, medium and long-term money.</p>

<p>Make a list of all your assets and liabilities and put each item into one of the three buckets. Now work out what proportion of your wealth you have in each bucket. How do you feel about the split?</p>

<h3>There is no right or wrong answer.</h3>

<p>People interpret these three goals and what goes into the buckets differently. For example, someone who is not familiar with stockmarket may see shares as ‘play money’ and put it in the last bucket. A lot of people argue that direct real estate investments are safe and therefore should go into the safety bucket.</p>

<h3>My suggestions would be –</h3>
<ul>
<li> Essentials bucket should include emergency cash, your home with the mortgage, insurance policies on your life/health/income, and any other term deposits, cash, government bond type investments you have for a near term goal. You can also count your ability to earn an income in this bucket i.e. your human capital.</li>

<li> Growth bucket should include all growth or risky assets that are listed - such as listed shares, REITs, corporate, high yield bonds etc. This is basically your ‘market’ portfolio, the one that your adviser gives advice on with an optimal asset allocation.</li>

<li> Freedom or play money bucket should include all unlisted assets such as direct real estate (with any mortgage), alternative investments like private equity or hedge funds, ESOPs, and holdings in family businesses (even in listed companies since you can’t sell in a hurry).</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned, the split varies from person to person. I have a lot in the Essentials and Freedom buckets, though my investment real estate in the latter has a good yield so could be counted in the Growth bucket. The most important thing is to consider how you feel about your Essentials bucket.</p> 

<h3>Or you can build a house</h3>

<p>Another way to look at this is to compare it to building a house.</p>

<p>Imagine you are the architect and you need to build a house. How would you go about it?</p>

<p>Firstly, you would need to lay down a foundation, on which you put down the floor. Then you would need to put some pillars in, which can hold the roof up. The foundation is like the Essentials bucket. You need to set aside some emergency cash to cover about 6 months’ expenses. Remember, your most important asset is your ability to earn an income, so you need to insure this.</p>

<p>The pillars represent your income. You can start with your employment (or business) income, but over time you can build another pillar, that of investment income. You could do this with a well-diversified portfolio of solid assets like real estate and shares.</p>

<p>The roof is your financial independence. It could be retirement or ‘early retirement at 40’. You build some assets that will fund all the things you wanted, all the luxuries. On top of the flat slab, you can also build a fancy sloping roof just because you can – this is your play money – which you can put into intellectually stimulating projects or give it away if you wish. </p>

<h3>Think in a way that suits you</h3>

<p>In summary, while financial advisers will obsess about the right asset allocation, they are really only talking about your financial assets. Even then, a lot of investors end up leaving out a portion of their wealth, which stays in very safe investments, when entrusting their portfolio to advisers. Non-financial assets such as the home, and sometimes even other real estate, gets left out of the discussion.</p>

<p>Yet, it’s useful to think about your overall wealth. And since most people have similar needs from their wealth – certainty for essentials, high probability for maintaining and possibility of much higher wealth – it might be an idea to use a 3-bucket framework. It allows you think to categorise investments based on the probability of loss and match them with your goals.</p>

<p>For people who are more visual, I find the house analogy also very useful. You can’t build a house without a solid foundation of emergency cash and insurance. Your income pillars – both your day job and investment income - hold up the roof of financial independence.</p>
